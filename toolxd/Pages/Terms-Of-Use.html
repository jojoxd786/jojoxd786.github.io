Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with the Company and affects your rights.&nbsp; It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.&nbsp; This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the requested relief.&nbsp; A Notice to the Company should be sent to <strong>contact@toolxd.com.</strong> After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.&nbsp; If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.&nbsp; The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.&nbsp; If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.&nbsp; The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.&nbsp; The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp; The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.&nbsp; Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.&nbsp; For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (the US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.&nbsp; Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.&nbsp; If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp; If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.&nbsp; Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.&nbsp; The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.&nbsp; The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp; The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp; In the event, any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY waives ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute is resolved by a judge.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential.&nbsp; The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.&nbsp; This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p><br>
